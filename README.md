# Stormageddon-Bot

Basic Bot for Discord

If you would like to help in the development of this bot, the discord is https://discord.gg/tgJtK7f.

Uses discord.io and winston (winston is for a debug logger, unneeded for final code)

Install Commands for Dependancies:

    - npm install discord.js

You will have to change some variables for your own use, copy the config.example.json to config.json and enter your settings.
